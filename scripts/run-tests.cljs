;; Why the exit code comes from a report method and not from the return value
;; of `run-tests`:
;;
;;   Under nbb `clojure.test/run-tests` returns nil, not a summary map. A
;;   runner that destructured the summary out of it computed `(+ nil nil)` = 0
;;   and called `(js/process.exit 0)` over a real failure, clobbering the
;;   nonzero code nbb had already put on process.exitCode itself.
;;
;; `:end-run-tests` on the default reporter is the hook that fires once the
;; whole run block has drained -- synchronous and async alike -- and carries
;; the real summary map. We `set!` process.exitCode rather than calling
;; process.exit, so Node still flushes stdout and finishes pending work.

;; Fail closed. If :end-run-tests never fires -- a namespace blew up mid-load,
;; the run was truncated -- the exit code stays nonzero. A run that could not
;; complete must not exit like a run that completed and passed.
