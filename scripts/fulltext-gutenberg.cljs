;; fulltext-gutenberg.cljs — Project Gutenberg public-domain full text.
;;
;; Uses gutendex.com (JSON, no key) which exposes `copyright: false` for
;; public-domain works. Only those are downloaded. Body goes under
;; fulltext/gutenberg/<id>/ (git-annex); bibliographic quads go to
;; 80-data/public/gutenberg.journal.edn (plain git, same as other sources).
;;
;; Usage (repo root):
;;   nbb --classpath src scripts/fulltext-gutenberg.cljs --seed "Pride and Prejudice" --limit 2
;;   nbb --classpath src scripts/fulltext-gutenberg.cljs --id 1342
;;   nbb --classpath src scripts/fulltext-gutenberg.cljs --from-seeds --limit 1
