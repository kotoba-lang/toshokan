;; kotobase-ingest-toshokan.cljs — pull-based batch fold job that closes
;; ADR-2607072300's "journal -> kotobase-peer fold job" gap for this repo,
;; the same shape as scripts/kotobase-ingest-cloud-itonami-lei.cljs
;; (ADR-2607113500) with one difference: that script fetches many *other*
;; repos' journals over the GitHub Contents API (105 cloud-itonami-lei-*
;; repos, one per company); this repo IS its own single source, so this
;; script reads `80-data/public/*.journal.edn` straight off the local
;; working tree instead.
;;
;; Run (from this repo's root, after `npm install` in kotobase-client once):
;;   NODE_PATH="<path-to>/kotobase-client/node_modules" npx nbb \
;;     --classpath "<path-to>/kotobase-client/src:src" \
;;     scripts/kotobase-ingest-toshokan.cljs
;;
;; Identity: a fresh Ed25519 seed is generated on first run and persisted to
;; scripts/.kotobase-ingest-toshokan-identity.hex (gitignored, NEVER commit
;; this file). The graph is `kotobase/db/<that-did>/toshokan-library-catalog`,
;; self-sovereign per ADR-2607072300/root CLAUDE.md's CACAO actor pattern.
;; Re-running with the SAME identity file re-asserts the same [entity attr]
;; facts (cardinality-one upsert per entity+attr, idempotent). Losing the
;; identity file starts a NEW, empty graph — back it up before treating it
;; as disposable.
;;
;; tx_edn wire shape (kotoba-lang/kotobase-server handler.cljc
;; `tx-edn->quads`): a vector of ENTITY MAPS `[{:db/id "e" :ns/attr v ...}
;; ...]` — same gotcha the LEI script's own header documents.
